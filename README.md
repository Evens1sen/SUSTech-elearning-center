# SUSTech-elearning-center-backend

This repo is the backend API for the SUSTech-elearning-center-backend

To set up the backend for the SUSTech-elearning-center-backend, 
you will need to install **MySQL 8** to establish the appropriate environment. 

First, create a database called **elearning** in MySQL, 
and then run the **elearning.sql** file to create the necessary tables.

The configuration file can be found at src/main/resources/application.yml. 
Although you can change your password to a personal preference, 
we recommend using **MySQLroot**, which will simplify the code merging process.

```
spring:
  datasource:
    url: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/elearning?useUnicode=true&characterEncoding=UTF-8&serverTimezone=UTC
    username: root
    password: MySQLroot
    driver-class-name: com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
```

Start the service by running **StoreApplication.java**. 
By default, the API documentation generated by Swagger2 can be found at http://localhost:8181/swagger-ui.html.
